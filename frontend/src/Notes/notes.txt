downgraded to react 18 beacuse react quill didn't compatible with the react 19

Look at the navigation bar(I just copy and pasted the code, if there is a time make the nav bar from scratch)

Look At the home page I didnt know ay code about the home page

min-h- doesnt work for the react quill

Features 
If something missing from a student there is a feature that can list the missing thing
(Found - to list by someone who found a bag or money)
(Missing - to list some thing that is missing)
Additional : Add some predefined categories like (Bag, Book, Pencil Case like that)

-----BUGS----
when creating category if user added space between words there is an error, so make sure to add only '-' between words
